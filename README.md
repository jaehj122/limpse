## What is different about the Glimpse fork?
The GNU Image Manipulation Program is primarily intended for long-standing Linux enthusiasts and power users.

Glimpse Image Editor is an optional alternative intended to assist users that are offended or made uncomfortable by the "gimp" name, and assist free software advocates that encounter barriers when they recommend the GNU Image Manipulation Program to friends, family, coworkers and employers.

Our project also focuses on making the software more "enterprise ready" so it is easier to modify and distribute for schools and workplaces. That means fewer "easter eggs", improved build and packaging tooling/documentation, backported fixes on a known-stable base we support for at least a year, and a more efficient Windows installer. 

We also plan to improve usability and accessibility through our choice of configuration settings, third-party plugins, and our own changes.

## How will the package versions work?
* limpse Image Editor 0.1.0 and 0.1.2 fork from Glimpse 0.2.0
* llimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 and 0.2.2 fork from GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.18

We are also working on a similar project in parallel called "Glimpse NX". That will be provide a more lightweight and accessible user interface for the same components that the GNU Image Manipulation Program uses. Keep an eye on our social media accounts and blog for more details.
